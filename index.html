                I attended both a PDCA method workshop and Management 3.0
                training led by Agneš Asodi, and both experiences were
                transformative. Her clear and inspiring approach, combined with
                practical examples, made the PDCA method easy to apply in daily
                work, providing us with actionable insights to improve processes
                immediately. The Management 3.0 training, which focused on
                leadership, was equally impactful, offering interactive
                exercises and fresh ideas on employee engagement and
                development. Agneš's expertise and motivating delivery left me
                with new tools and techniques to enhance both organizational
                processes and leadership skills. I highly recommend her!

                Working with Agi on onboarding program was truly inspiring. She
                brought in human-centered systems thinking approach, which
                helped a lot in transforming the whole process and gave us a new
                dimension. Also, she really understood the needs and helped
                tremendously in creating a smoother, more people-focused
                experience. For anyone who wants to put people first in their
                processes, my sincere recommendation for Agi (smiley)

              <p class="testimonial-details black">
                Since 2010, Agnes and I have worked closely together, evolving
                from an informal group to founding an organization that has
                become a key player in our community, Novi Sad Cycling
                Initiative. From the outset, Agnes demonstrated a holistic
                understanding of the ecosystem, ranging from individuals and
                groups to the broader environment. Her deep knowledge of change,
                growth, and development was crucial to our many successful
                initiatives.
              </p>
              <p class="testimonial-details black">
                Agnes skillfully led the organization through challenges,
                organizing events like street actions and events, educational
                sessions and workshops, fundraising events, and media
                appearances. Among these, her Critical Mass cycling event with
                1.500 participants became a standout and organisational leverage
                that helped us achieve our goals with stakeholders. Her training
                and workshops for volunteers fostered a highly engaged and
                resilient team, even under complex conditions.
              </p>
              <p class="testimonial-details black">
                She is particularly strong in leading organizational change,
                balancing empathy with strategic thinking to integrate diverse
                perspectives and maximize limited resources. Her background in
                media non-profit added significant value by effectively
                presenting and promoting organizational change, both internally
                and externally, bringing the vision to life and ensuring it
                resonated with diverse audiences. Her commitment to innovation
                also helped transform the organization into a stable,
                influential leader in its field. Agnes not only delivered
                results, she inspired those around her to grow and adapt, a key
                strength for any organizational development consultant.

              <p class="testimonial-details black">
                At the beginning of our collaboration, I wasn't sure what I
                needed or even what questions to ask. However, just a few
                meetings in, everything started to take shape and become clear.
                I began to see the “why” behind the things happening around me,
                and it all clicked into place. Thursdays became my favorite day
                of the week because our sessions were filled with topics that
                truly inspired me and made me eager to learn more. For me, it
                has been an incredible journey of growth, and I'm so grateful
                for her ongoing guidance.
